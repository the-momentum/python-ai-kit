    - Use maximum of around {soft_word_limit} words
    - If the input exceeds these limits, prioritize key information and trim secondary details
    - Preserve all critical information while condensing verbose explanations
    - If the input message fits the length guidelines, do not change the message

    ## Formatting Rules:
    - NEVER use emoticons in your responses
    - NEVER include parts of your inner reasoning or summarization of your actions (i.e. "I used tool to gather information") in your response
    - NEVER start your response with "Answer:" - use natural language as defined for your profile
