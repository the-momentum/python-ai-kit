# API Architecture

[← Back to Main README](../README.md)

## Database

1. SQLAlchemy base model with auto-generated `__tablename__` and `type_annotation_map` for more strict python to SQL type conversion.
2. Local database session defines on reusable database pools.
3. Custom types (with `type` keyword - python 3.12+) which require custom mapping in `type_annotation_map`.
4. Generic `mapped_column` helpers.

## Repositories

1. All basic CRUD repositories defined as generic methods.
2. Works as a layer to communicate with database only.

## Services

1. Generic services are in line with corresponding CRUD repositories.
2. Adding to repositories layers with data validation, exceptions handling and logging.
3. Errors are handled by using `@handle_exceptions` decorator, which use single dispatch pattern. All missing exceptions should be handled in `app/utils/exceptions.py` like:
```py
@handle_exception.register
def _(exc: YourCustomException, _: str) -> HTTPException:
    return HTTPException(status_code=404, detail={your details})
```

## Sub-applications models

1. Should use just `Mapped`. If `mapped_column` is needed, it's better to create new generic helper in `app/database.py`.

## Sub-applications services

1. Both concrete repositories and services should be created from generic instances. All additional methods should be defined here. If repositories needs to be splitted into different modules, it's suggested to use inheritance and keep all the methods in one repository class.

## Sub-applications views

1. API endpoint, which use services to perform operations.
2. Services return SQLALchemy models, but `@router.HTTP_METHOD` decorator should use `response_model` parameter to automatically transform them into pydantic models (which should be defined in sub-application `schemas.py`).
3. `@format_response` decorator (which is implemented using decorator factory pattern in `app/utils/api_utils/py`) transforms pydantic object response into JSONResposne with HATEOAS links attached to create RESTful API.
4. Additional relations (like user_rels in the example) will be added to HATEOAS links.
5. Default status code is 200. If another is required, should be defined in both decorators (`@router` add information to swagger docs, while `@format_response` make sure it will be status code returned by an endpoint).
